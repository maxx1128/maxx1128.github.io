* Added in Sass to the workflow
* Changed to a side nav pattern (embed the example from Brad Frost's Responsive Patterns resource?)
* Changed naming scheme to Base/Component/Pattern, with similar definitions on how they're defined.
    * Organized Sass files this way too
* Auto-generate Global element documentation
* Used a markdown converter so annotations can be written separately. Easier so someone else on the project with less coding experience can still add and edit copy to the Pattern Library.
    * Moved annotations to above the element on any page with multiple elements
* Integrated global var and values into Pattern Lab external elements
* Integrated BEM and namespacing (https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/06/battling-bem-extended-edition-common-problems-and-how-to-avoid-them/)


Later planning to add more elements, another page or two.
