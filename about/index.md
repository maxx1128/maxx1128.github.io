Hello, you've reached the About Page of Max Antonucci. I'm likely not here right now, so please read the following major info about myself and leave a issue or pull request after the footer.

### I'm a Coder

Some backstory: I originally studied journalism in college, but halfway through I started front-end programming and got gradually immersed in it. I wound up doing more coding than writing during my studies, until it was all I wanted to focus on. Two days after graduation, I was working as a developer.

My biggest focus now is still front-end development, for several reasons: combining logic and creativity, making cool-looking components, always learning more, and the confused looks of people watching me work. I focus most on:

* The big three: HTML, CSS and Javascript.
* Preprocessors for the big three, such as Nunjucks, Liquid, Pug, and Sass.
* I've got a special love of Sass architecture. So far my favorite system combines ITCSS, BEM, and mapping global variables.
* Gulp.js to automate builds, optimizations, added functions, testing, and balancing my checkbook. It does it all.
* Jekyll for static-site generation. You'd be amazed how often it works better than WordPress.
* Front-end Architecture and Atomic Design for organized, scalable code. I'm a big fan of [PatternLab.io](http://patternlab.io/) for this.
* Basic UI and UX design.

### I'm a Writer

While coding is what ultimately stuck with me, I still enjoyed studying journalism. I wrote for the Daily Orange and did technical-focused features for The NewsHouse, as well as some data and visual reporting. My main thing was features on tough topics like religion and gun control, since I enjoy exploring hard topics most people like to avoid. As you can imagine, this helped my writing but not my dating life. I later wrote opinion columns on travel and politics.

Today my writing is sadly limited to my blog, though I'd like to write more serious articles in the future if possible.

### I'm a Freethinker

My most prized possessions actually **aren't** my laptop, my laptop backups, or my laptop stickers. It's my ability to think and imagine freely. They're unique traits among humans that are important to embrace. Otherwise we risk losing our very humanity.

Don't be surprised if a good chunk of what I write, or especially tweet, has a philosophical edge. Asking unexpected questions and questioning unexpected things are ultimately our best weapons as people. Do we truly have free will? Is human nature innately positive or negative? How much can we trust our memories and perceptions? Can we tell when others are unconsciously manipulating our thoughts and decisions? Perhaps most importantly, what's a moral way to live life?

If the sky is falling, what was holding it up in the first place? Is it falling because of something we did or something we need to figure out? Is it a warning, an apocalypse, or the start of a horrible Keanu Reeves movie? 

These, and more, are the thoughts that keep me up at night. I'll send a press release about them eventually.

#### Random Facts About Me You May Enjoy

1. **I'm an amateur guitar player.** I've only been doing it for a year so far. Don't expect me to play much at office parties anytime. Even when I get somewhat bearable.
2. **I enjoy boxing in the mornings.** It's better to get all that aggression out before any meetings. Punching bags don't have any chances to poison my lunch in the late morning after hitting them in the chest.
3. **I'm obsessed with the Phoenix Wright Franchise.** Formal clothes aside, what's not to love about people who generate pure awesome from a mix of logic, murders, magic lie-detecting superpowers, inane legal systems, and yelling? Nothing.
4. **I make buttons.** Buttons are fun ways to share little ideas, and also make amazing gifts. It's one of those purchases that pays for itself while making all of your clothes quirkier.

### A Summary of Me

As you can tell from the above (because I know you didn't skip to the end) I am a nerd with a budding coding career, offbeat sense of humor, a love of being intellectual, and lackluster dating skills. But I like what I do and what I think about, despite knowing I'll *always* have more to do in both. If anything, the fact that I need to keep learning is why I enjoy coding.

Also I don't drink coffee. Seems unimportant, but I assumed there's a law about coffee jokes in these things.

All done! You may now half-heartedly chuckle and navigate to another page here or elsewhere on the web.
