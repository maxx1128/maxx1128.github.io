  <h4>I'm a front-end web developer in southern CT</h4>

  <h5>My background includes journalism and social media</h5>

  <h6>Also enjoy reading, writing, philosophy, and a little boxing.</h6>

  <h6>I'm an avid freethinker, and my higher power is imagination</h6>

  <h6>In short, a curious and offbeat computer nerd.</h6>
