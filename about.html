<p>I’m Max Antonucci, and for all of my career, I’ve been living in different parts of the digital world.</p>

<p>First it was writing for it as a journalism major. Then doing marketing in it for a few internships. I settled on coding for it as a web developer, but I still love playing in the other areas.</p>

<p>That’s why I’m an all-around digital thinker. I was for most of my time in college, and still am for current job. This includes front-end development of well-performing sites, marketing and analytics to help get them noticed, writing content to convey their message, and social media so they have a real voice for chatting with others.</p>

<p>There’s also the part that loves online videos and movies in the background, but that’s the part of my digital life I try to limit. Results are mixed, at best.</p>

<p>It’s all for a simple reason: I’m an idea fanatic. At my core I believe that as humans, the best thing we can do is find, share, understand, debate, and create new ideas with each other. They expand our views and experiences, and can make for really amazing tweets. The Internet is the best platform today for finding and sharing new ideas. So I channel my passion for ideas into a passion for all things digital, so more people can join the idea marketplace.</p>

<p>So join the booming idea economy! Get a good bit of Internet real estate together and join the give and take. If you need some help there, I’m happy to oblige. I’m trying to learn a bit more every day for just that.</p>
