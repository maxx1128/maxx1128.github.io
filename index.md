### Max here

I studied journalism in school for a love of writing. I switched to front-end development halfway through for a similar love of coding. I keep breathing because of my love of oxygen. I’m a curious freethinker and passionate puzzle-solver. However I have a serious daydreaming habit and don’t have telekinetic powers. No one is perfect.
