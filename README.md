# Jekyll-Webpack

My site uses Jekyll and Webpack - one for the site as a whole, the other for asset management and bundling.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install npm dependencies with `npm install`
2. Install gem dependencies `bundle install`
3. Start serving with `npm start`
4. Go to `localhost:4000` to see my site!
