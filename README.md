This is the Jekyll code for my personal site. I migrated to it from WordPress since it's faster and much easier to maintain. Just made with basic Sass and Liquid templates, and also a few plugins.

* Bourbon for sass mixins
* Ellisha for a flexbox-based layout
* Hover.css for simple hover animation
