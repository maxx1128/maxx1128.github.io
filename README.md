# Personal Site

This is the uncompiled Jekyll code for my Personal Website. The components were built out with Pattern Lab, and you can see [the pattern library (called Puzzle Pieces) here.](http://maxwellantonucci.com/puzzle-pieces/)

## Setup Instructions

1. Install gem dependencies `bundle install`
2. Run Jekyll with `jekyll serve --incremental --watch`
3. Go to `localhost:4000` to see my site!
