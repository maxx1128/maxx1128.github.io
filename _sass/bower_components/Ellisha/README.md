Ellisha is basically a flexbox version of Susy. It's a collection of mixins to create responsive, flexbox layouts in whatever style developers want. It's lightweight, customizable, and prefixed for different browser usage.

This is for front-end developers who want to take the advantages of Flexbox and apply it to their entire site. This includes columns that calculate their own width, controlling their positions with more precision, easy vertical centering, and whatever else flexbox can do for their site's layout.
