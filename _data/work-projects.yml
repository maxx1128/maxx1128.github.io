  description: "I'm a huge fan of the Phoenix Wright series, but was upset to see there wasn't a Lorem Ipsum generator for it. So I found the WikiQuote page for the series, took the best lines I could find, and made a Node.js Lorem Ipsum generator with them. Now template sites can fill empty space with the voices of Wright, Edgeworth, Maya, and (most of) the whole cast."

  description: "My first official project with Ruby uses Sinatra and the Pokemon API to create a basic pokedex. It makes use of many basics, such as templating and partials, setting URL paths, using input data, navigating complex data through views, and got me started on Heroku. It still needs fine-tuning, but was my first big step forward with Ruby and the server-side of web development."

It focused on racial and economic disparities related to housing in Syracuse. My main jobs were helping make interactive content, changing styles, and editing the back-end functionality with custom fields and programming.'

  description: 'My main job as Web Development intern at Eric Mower + Associates was to remake the intern blog. The final product was a WordPress theme built for over 100 posts with Sass and Gulp.js, along with a few useful tools such as Isotope.js and Advanced Custom Fields. The front page also lets users search a grid of all the posts by the internâ€™s semester, the city they interned in, and what department they worked in. The final product came out just in time for me and the other Spring 2015 interns to get their posts up!'
