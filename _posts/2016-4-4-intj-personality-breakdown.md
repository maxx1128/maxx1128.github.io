I rediscovered a favorite site of mine: 16Personalities. It's a playful take on the Myers Briggs Personality test. I shared it with my co-workers, who liked the quirky visuals and interesting info. Most of all the quirky visuals. I can't blame them.

It's not hard to understand why the site's so appealing - to me, humans have an innate desire to learn more about themselves. The reasons for this vary, from improving one's career to building better relationships. Regardless, that bit of human nature is likely the root of the site's appeal. The execution is the tasty icing on the cake.

**HOLD IT!**

While this instinct is good for our curiosity, it can be bad when groups try to take advantage of it. People who take the test get free info, but it promises even more in their $32.99 "Premium Profiles." They make some pretty huge promises, from finally feeling understood to adding meaning to one's life. Things most people search for their entire lives...but now available to buy online!

So caution with these kinds of "discover yourself at last" websites is a must. Especially if you're tempted to buy a copy.

### The Big Question

In the name of caution, analysis, and writing a blog post, I broke down my own personality profile's accuracy. It's not about knowing if the "Premium Profile" is worth purchasing, but more I can even trust the free version. I can't rate how accurate all 16 personalities are, but I can at least how much mine is. I hope it can serve as a good reference for anyone who has, or is thinking of, taking the test.

Plus it's a good excuse to reference some of their graphics in my blog. I'm serious, you'll be reading through every profile just to see them all. I can't be the only one who does that...right?

#### My Results

A couple tries with the test paired me with the **INTJ personality.** It's the giant nerd full of intellectual nonsense, eccentric thoughts, and next to no hope in romance on their good days. So the personality is a great fit, aside from it being optimistic about my dating life.

For the rest of the post I'll look at the biggest elements of the personality profile and give it a grade. At the end I'll average them all together for the final result. I consider anything about a 7 as a passing grade.

Anyway, let's get to it!

###### INTJs are Major Bookworms

*"With a natural thirst for knowledge that shows itself early in life, INTJs are often given the title of “bookworm” as children. ...They more than likely identify with it and are even proud of it..."*

I'm writing this on the day I got [nearly 800 pages of contemporary philosophy](http://www.amazon.com/The-Stone-Reader-Philosophy-Arguments/dp/1631490710) in the mail, so it's accurate. Need more convincing? Here's the bulkiest part of my bookshelf:

This doesn't even include my most recent purchase:

The rest contains graphic novels, drawing books, some fiction novels, and a wine flask. That last one's less about reading and more about how I spend reading time, but still proves my point.

**Grade: 10/10**

###### INTJs live Paradoxically

*"INTJs are able to live by glaring contradictions that nonetheless make perfect sense – at least from a purely rational perspective. For example, INTJs are simultaneously the most starry-eyed idealists and the bitterest of cynics..."*

This is pretty correct, as it seems to explain in part why people claim they never fully understand me. One day I've reflected on one belief, and the next reflected on another that goes against it. These kinds of thoughts aren't a major part of me, though they're there.

A good example would be extreme hope in humanity one day, and being a huge misanthrope the next. One can love all the small things humans have done and our potential to improve, yet hate all the negative steps we've taken. The two views conflict and grind, but can still co-exist. They're like college roommates arguing but never going as far as lighting the other's bed on fire.

**Grade: 9/10**

###### INTJs are Ruthlessly Logical and Pragmatic

*"INTJs will strive to remain rational no matter how attractive the end goal may be, and every idea...must pass the ruthless and ever-present 'Is this going to work?' filter."*

As much as I don't like to admit this, it's true. The foundation of all my decisions are logical, such as how they will affect my or other's lives. Doing something as an empty gesture goes over my head, which also goes back to the "no hope in romance" thing. It's not all bad, as this mindset has helped me develop my coding work.

The caveat I'll add here is that while it's true, *it's not a constant.* This "ruthless pragmatism" is like gravity: always pulling but not defining me. With some conscious thought I can act more on emotion, like buying a thoughtful gift or (insert emotional activity here). It's almost like a muscle I'm trying to develop, and need to since being all logic, all the time doesn't make me happy.

**Grade: 7/10**

###### INTJs hate Social Conventions.

*"INTJs may go so far as to see many social conventions as downright stupid."*

I appreciate the description getting right to the point. although I'd also accept that they suck, are a waste of time, or are bits of wasted comfort that hold us back. Stupid works though.

To me, social conventions are extra rules we don't need yet have to learn to waste time and appease others. Worst of all, they make people dance around a point or idea they want to express. While this can be great fun to listen to from another room, it's aggravating when it happens to me.

You may wonder how someone can hate social conventions and not be a mole living in the mountains alone. First, mountains have surprisingly high rent and no plumbing. Second, as much as I hate social conventions, long as they're a part of civil society, I'll just have to deal with them.

**Grade: 10/10**

###### INTJs Struggle with Emotions

*"...INTJs often feel them more strongly than many overtly emotional types because they simply haven't learned how to control them effectively."*

Fun fact: in all the profiles I've checked, INTJs are the **only** ones with a section on emotions. Seems emotions are THAT big a problem for my personality type.

{% include image.html url="/img/posts/personality-test/emotions.png" description="Emotions and INTJs are like an old, squabbling married couple - they pair so oddly you wonder how they even wound up together. Graphic courtesy of 16Personalities" %}

I won't deny this. Emotions are too rarely part of how I make decisions, despite being just as powerful (if not more so) as the average person. The result is not noticing how turbulent they get until I'm running in the streets screaming the first sad song I hit on my iPhone. For health and public humiliation reasons, this is something I've tried to deal with but have had a hard time doing so.

I wouldn't say it's hopeless though. Once I'm more aware of them, making good decisions with them is natural. The big issue, at least for me, is awareness and everyday management. Not quite the kinds of issues the profile describes, but pretty close.

###### INTJs are Open-minded

*"INTJs stay open to new ideas, supported by logic, even if (and sometimes especially if) they prove INTJs' previous conceptions wrong."*

Some may disagree, but I do keep a pretty open-mind. I won't dismiss an idea as dumb right away. I'll listen to the idea, think it over, get a couple arguments together for why I think it's dumb, and *then* dismiss it.

This would explain my habit of reading articles and Internet comments I know I'll disagree with. I first thought it was a form of intellectual sado-masochism, but that wasn't in the profile so I guess it isn't true.

**Grade: 9/10**

###### INTJs are Arrogant

*"INTJs can be brutally insensitive in making their opinions of others all too clear."*

This is like the "ruthless pragmatism" and "social conventions" answers above. It's true, but I try to control it. I limit my opinions of others, idiots or otherwise, to when I'm alone in my car on the highway with the windows up. Then I go nuts until I arrive home with a sore throat.

So if anyone's bugged my car, I'm at your mercy.

**Grade: 8/10**

###### INTJs Suck at Romance

*"...adds up to a personality type that is often clueless in dating."*

All jokes about my romance-less life should answer this one already. I feel no need or desire to say more.

However, one bit on the site I found interesting:

*"The positive side of INTJs' 'giving up' is that they are most attractive when they aren't trying to be attractive..."*

Thinking back, this is quite true. The less I tried to be romantic in the part, the more romantic things became with someone else. So my current strategy of "keeping myself too busy to care" is more than a technique to limit my drinking, it's also how I'll find a soulmate. Aces!

**Grade: 11/10**

###### INTJs prize Open, Honest Communication

*"They prize honest, open communication, and all factors of the relationship are open to discussion and change..."*

Yes please. Do not dance around the point. I'd rather someone said the truth and hurt me feelings a bit instead of be evasive with me. The benefits of hearing the truth always beat a few unhurt feelings.

**Grade: 9/10**

###### INTJs work best with freedom and solitude

*"INTJs tend to prefer to work alone, or at most in small groups, where they can maximize their creativity and focus without repeated interruptions..."*

This is pretty accurate based on my work history. My least favorite part of journalism was creating and maintaining a huge network of contacts for info. I have a hard enough time managing what little social relationships I have. I didn't want that to be my job as well.

{% include image.html url="/img/posts/personality-test/INTJ1.png" description="Working in solitude from a mix of choice and lame social skills. Probably more one than the other. Graphic courtesy of 16Personalities" %}

Coding is a better fit - it's me, a computer screen, endless experiments, and lots of open-source info and tools to work with. Great for being creative and logical, solo and in a community, all at once. Granted, I do miss hanging around an offices full of smart, weird, and overworked nerds...but no career is perfect.

**Grade: 8/10**

### Final Grade: 8.9/10

I can say the 16Personalities profile is surprisingly accurate. The profiles could be vague or repetitive (the conclusion pages are all the same), but they're still worth reading. At least do it to see how the cartoons they made for your personality type.

Do I think the Premium Profile is worth it? No, and no matter how high my grade is, I never will. Paying a site for promises that they'll understand you like no other and make you successful is almost guaranteed to be con. I recommend reading the site for a mix of good info, enjoyable time-killing, and something fun to share with others.

Not the best recommendation, but like everything in the world, it's worth it just for the cartoons.
