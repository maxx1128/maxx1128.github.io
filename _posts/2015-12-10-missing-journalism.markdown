Post on how even though I like web development, all the parts of journalism I miss the most?
- Punctuate each point with a small anecdote.

- Expanding horizons by talking to so many others
- Satisfying feeling of the story telling itself so fluidly along the page
- The idea that spreading stories for individuals can somehow change a group of people, large or small. The ways we're human changing the ways we're a society.

Last example to drive it all home was about how I wound up working as a general purpose coder for the My Housing Matters project. Enjoyed the different puzzles of WordPress, but felt envious of all the stories everyone else was helping tell. Like being a tech person that holds the structure of it all together since it makes me feel needed. But also liked being someone who took a real interest in others to make others see more than their own world.

Which feeling do I like more? Although I've chosen my path I don't dwell too much. But on the rare times I do, there's a lot of gray area around it.
