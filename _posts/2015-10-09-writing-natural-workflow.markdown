I really do want to write more. Seeing this blog with few regular updates is a big source of nighttime anger and sheet-wringing.

But every time I set time to sit and work on content, my brain dries up. Whether it’s writing, drawing, or just thinking through a good post, nothing appears on the screen right.

I think my lack of content is because the way I write content feels too forced.

When your job requires being in front of a computer screen for hours already, adding even more time to work on things outside of work becomes an impossible chore. As much as I love being online, there’s a limit. Whenever I want to focus on writing something substantive, too often I’ve already hit that limit.

> Computer burnout never leads to good content.

At that point, I’m forcing the content out. Forcing content dooms it all to be awkward and unenjoyable from the start.

Even with drawing a picture for a post, nothing comes out right. For one post idea I had about how frustrating one’s 20’s are, I stopped this it was too rough and bland. You can see for yourself here.

Compare this to what I draw when I’m not focused on a post: much smoother and interesting (if at tons of different angles).

I think the key is finding a more natural workflow for writing. Since I’m often already on Internet overload, it’s important to develop content while away from the screen.

* Writing things free-hand and saving the computer parts for the end.
* Having a bigger offline life, and basing more content off those experiences.
* Writing in different places, even if it’s just different parts of the house.
* Don’t be afraid of short posts. As long as there’s a strong idea, length doesn’t matter.
* The next time I have a content idea, I’m not forcing it. I’m staying away from my computer, or else my mind and hands will go stale before I type the first letter. I’ll be sitting by my dry bar, laying on a couch with my feet over the side, or running around in circles – long as it’s somewhere my thoughts will actually flow. The end results will be more spontaneous and less forced, more thoughtful and less synthetic.

That way, when it finally gets on this blog, I’ll be happy I wrote it. Something that was a joy to create, not a chore.
