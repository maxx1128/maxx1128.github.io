You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="VvaLgr" data-default-tab="result" data-user="max1128" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/max1128/pen/VvaLgr/'>Number Guessing Game</a> by Maxwell Antonucci (<a href='http://codepen.io/max1128'>@max1128</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
