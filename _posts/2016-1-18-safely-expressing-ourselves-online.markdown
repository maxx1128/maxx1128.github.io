If I had to chose my least favorite effect the Internet has on people, it's one I've shared before: how it makes us fear expressing ourselves.

I don't believe a person's identity means much if they can't express it to others, at least a little. Expressing our views and ideas to others and seeing how their effect makes them meaningful. An identity based on helping the poors means nothing if you don't do something to help the poor. Even if that's as small as increase awareness of poverty.

One would think the Internet, with so many ways to share ideas, would help this. But for many people it can have the opposite effect. Part of human nature is that people will always disagree with you. This itself isn't bad, but is when disagreement gets public, vicious, and commonplace. Express a view that people disagree with enough, regardless of its logic, and one risks huge amounts of harassment. There's endless examples of people sending tweets that got them fired or created international scandal. Sharing views that did a lot more harm than just a few people disagreeing with it.

But is this really a bad thing? Look at some of the specifics, see how these views were likely deserving of genuine outrage. Entitlement, blatant ignorance, or prejudice shouldn't go unchallenged just because they're sincerely held beliefs. It's like saying a sincerely held belief that only black people get AIDs should be left alone. Even if it's shared by a major US official (example link).

Is there a balance to strike here? Some rule to keep in mind of then to let expressions be and when to question them?

Maybe not. This statement implies that there are some expressions which should always be questions and some which never should. But are there expressions that should never be questioned? Facts we should never ask for backup data on? Religious beliefs we shouldn't see if they're based on morality or outdated dogma? Political views we shouldn't search for ulterior motives to control or manipulate in? Personal views to see if they're based on positive priciples or negative egocentrism?

George Carlin said it well that people should be raised to question everything. Since everything we accept without questioning to some extent gives someone a chance to exert control. Even the things we were raised to except, the things we grow up loving, were told to like for any number of reasons, deserve a little skepticism.

Let's bring this back to my original issue: how the Internet creates a fear of self-expression. From my own conclusion it looks like there's no way around this. That fear of excessive criticism and consequence will always be there.

The truth is there is no way around this. Part of being an adult is accepting greater consequences for ones actions, and how one speaks is a part of that. Kids can get away with offensive speech more often since they're seen as "still learning" or "don't understand what they're saying." Adults are expected to know what they say or not say it at all. Their freedom of speech comes with the responsibility of informed speech.

It's also a responsibility I feel is important to accept and live up to.

That in the end, damage done by standing by your principles against those who’d hate you for them isn’t as bad as the damage done by not having any. Would rather be hurt by people disagreeing with my character than by not having any.
