Frustrating as it is, our minds are like slot machines.

At our High Points we're inspired, focused, remember crucial details, and assess what we're told. At our Low Points we're none of those - lost, hazy, distracted and gullible.

So many factors affect which one we're at: our environment, hobbies, food, rest, and random chance. In the end, whether we're at a High or Low Point can feel random. And often is.

This isn't surprising to anyone whose started middle school. It's likely a fact of life we take for granted. But we shouldn't. Learning to control our mind's High and Low Points is crucial to two things:

1. **Reaching our full potential.** Letting our High Points slip away and our Low Points dominate us waste what we're capable of. 
2. **Don't get jerked around.** Lots of people and companies make money off of people controlled by their Low Points. Scams, salesmen, con artists, or little things everyday people do to mess with us. They work best on people in a Low Point.

There's dangers to feeling too many Low Points. No one can keep them out completely. But we can keep them from dragging our lives down.

#### Don't Let Low Points Own Us

There's some simple ways to maximize our High Points so our Low Points sabotage our lives less. It just takes some awareness of where your thoughts are, and doing little things to improve them.

The first big thing is to **find passive ways to keep your mind active.** Lots of things we do to relax dull our thoughts and invite more Low Points, like watching too much TV. But there's many other ways to relax and recharge that keep your mind going. Listening to audiobooks or podcasts, or reading books, stretch your imagination more than TV. Or just being more creative, like playing an instrument doing simple crafts. Little things exercise your mind, even if just a little.

> Do as many important things as possible during High Points, and as few as possible during Low Points.

The second is to **plan ahead of your High and Low points.** It's good to keep a journal of good ideas or future projects for when a High Point hits. It's also helpful to make and record important decisions, so they're not made during a fuzzy Low Point.

For example, planning a vacation or writing a big grocery list is better saved for a High Point, even if they're not for a long time. Habits like this help you record your best thoughts during High Points and save them during Low Points.

#### Summing Up

Humans have a proud tradition of trying to, or pretending to, completely control things they can't control. I think it's at the root of so many lies we keep going along with every day, whether they're personal ones or encouraged by society. But with our brains we can work around the Highs and Low points we can't control.

I can speak from personal experience that trying to totally control your thoughts at all times lasts until mental exhaustion hits. If this happens while driving, a car or truck will hit after.

As you'd guess, this is bad.

So remember to work around your Low Points, not try to remove them altogether. Work with your thoughts, not against them. Avoid that mental wall, and possible a wall of deadly scrap metal and pavement.
