Want to be productive? Never think any new tool or skill will fix your problems.

If you find something new and amazing, think of your mind going along these two paths:

You’re delighted, and immediately forget it. You think it can fix most, if not all, of your troubles today. Its a huge relief knowing they’ll be off your back fast. So you put this new thing aside, eager to explore it later when you have the time, and begin a new journey. The second you do this, your relief-filled mind goes on to some distractions to congratulate yourself.

Now try this version:

You’re a little encouraged, and quickly make it a habit. Your problems don’t have a “silver bullet” to fix them overnight, and this is no exception. Nothing serious is solved that fast. But it can still make these struggles a bit easier to handle. Another tool to make life’s next plot twist less likely to push you back a few steps. If you want this small advantage, you better learn it fast before another challenge pops up. You grit your teeth, do the work to understand it, and keep it in mind as you resume searching.

Whatever this thing is, you commit it to memory knowing it’ll come in handy, but never knowing when.

Good solutions are never a “do it once, move on” kind of thing. They’re a change in habit that makes everything better on a regular basis, so they solve the problem overtime.

This lesson is a hard yet vital one for many fields, especially web development since there’s tons of shiny plugins, frameworks, trends, and hacks out all the time. It’s easy to think just one tool or strategy will solve all our coding woes. I’ve felt that way for an unlimited number of tools I found, and many books I planned to read but never got the time to.

It’s like the more excited I was for something at first, the likelier I was to totally forget it.

Don’t focus on the tool. Focus on the habit. That’s what makes a difference in the long term.
