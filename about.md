Hello, you've reached the About Page of Max Antonucci. I'm likely not here right now, so please read the following major info about myself and leave a issue or pull request after the footer:

### I'm a Coder

My biggest career focus now is front-end development. You may ask why if you're okay with me asking hypotheticals for you. It's for several reasons: combining logic and creativity, always learning more, and I enjoy the confused looks on people's faces if they look over my shoulder. The areas I focus on most are:

* The big three: HTML, CSS and Javascript
* Preprocessors for the big three: Nunjucks, Jade, and Sass
* Gulp.js to automate builds, optimizations, added functions, testing, and balancing my checkbook. It does it all.
* Front-end Architecture and Atomic Design for organized, scalable code
* Javascript Frameworks, mainly Angular.js
* Collecting and managing Google Analytics data

While I'm not officially recognized as a **major** computer nerd by the Computer Nerd Overlords Organization of the Galaxy, I'm still certified as an above-average computer nerd. Once I clear the final certifications held in California every January, I'll be set.

### I'm a Writer

While I'm a coder now, my original college major was journalism at Syracuse University. I wrote for the Daily Orange and did technical-focused features for The Newshouse, as well as learning data and visual reporting. My main thing was features on tough topics like religion and gun control, since I enjoy exploring hard topics most people like to avoid. As you can imagine, this helped my brand as a writer but not my dating life. I later wrote opinion columns on travel and politics too.

It was only until a fateful encounter with an journalism startup class did I discover my other love for coding. It became a love triangle that coding eventually won, which has defined my career (and most of my dating life again) ever since.

Today my writing is sadly limited to my personal blog, though I look forward to doing more serious blog articles or reporting in the future if I get the chance.

### I'm a Freethinker

My most prized possessions actually **aren't** my laptop, my laptop backups, or the stickers I put on my laptop case. It's simply my ability to think and imagine freely. I enjoy reading and thinknig about philosophy since it's a truly unique trait we have as humans and it's important to embrace. Otherwise we risk our humanity and much of our independence. Not much different than those robots that go around cleaning floors, and I haven't had the right training for that work.

Don't be surprised if a good chunk of what I write, or especially tweet, has a philosophical edge. Asking unexpected questions and questioning unexpected things are ultimately our best weapons as people. Do we truly have free will? Is human nature innately positive or negative? How much can we trust our memories and perceptions? Can we tell when others are unconsciously manipulating our thoughts and decisions? Perhaps most importantly, what's a moral way to live life?

I'm not done yet!

If the sky is falling, what was holding it up in the first place? Is it falling because of something we did or something we need to figure out? Is it a warning, an apocalypse, or the start of a horrible Keanu Reeves movie? These, and more, are the thoughts that keep me up at night.

Once I figure out what book I'm checking out from the library this weekend, I'll get back to you on all this.

#### Random Facts About Me You May Enjoy

1. **I do occassional cartoon drawings.** My big favorite is caricatures of people - ones I know or random ones I see. Who doesn't love a cartoon doppleganger?
2. **I'm an amateur guitar player.** I've only been doing it for a few months. Don't expect me to play at office parties anytime soon. Even when I get somewhat bearable.
3. **I enjoy boxing in the mornings.** It's better to get all that aggression out before any meetings. Punching bags don't have any chances to poison my lunch in the late morning after hitting them in the chest.
4. **I'm obsessed with the Phoenix Wright Franchise.** Formal clothes aside, what's not to love about people who generate pure awesome from a mix of logic, muders, magic lie-detecting superpowers, inane legal systems, and yelling? Nothing.

### A Summary of Me

As you can tell from the above (because I know you didn't just skip to the end) I am a nerd with a budding coding career, quirky sense of humor, odd collection of hobbies, a love of being intellectual, and lackluster dating skills. But I like what I do and what I think about, despite knowing I'll *always* have a lot more work to do in both areas.

Also I don't drink coffee. Seems unimportant, but I assumed there's a law about coffee jokes when one writes these things.

All done! You may now half-heartedly chuckle and navigate to another page here or elsewhere on the web.

Cheers,
Max A
