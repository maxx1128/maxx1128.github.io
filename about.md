Hello, you've reached the About Page of Max Antonucci. I'm likely not here right now, so please read the following major info about myself and leave a message after the footer:

### I'm a Coder

My biggest career focus now is coding, specifically front-end development. It's for several reasons: combining logic and creativity, always learning more, and code doesn't schedule pointless meetings during work. The areas I focus on most are:

* The big three: HTML, CSS and Javascript
* Preprocessors for the big three: Nunjucks, Jade, and Sass
* Gulp.js to automate builds, optimizations, added functions, and balancing my checkbook.
* Front-end Architecture and Atomic Design for organized, scalable code
* Javascript Frameworks, mainly Angular.js
* Collecting and managing Google Analytics data

While I'm not officially recognized as a **major** computer nerd by the Computer Nerd Overlords Organization of the Galaxy, I'm still certified as an above-average computer nerd. Getting better every day as well.

### I'm a Writer

While I'm a coder now, my original college major was journalism at Syracuse University. I wrote for the Daily Orange and did technical-focused features for The Newshouse, as well as learning data and visual reporting. My main thing was features on tough topics like religion and gun control, since I enjoy exploring hard topics (as you can imagine, this hasn't helped my dating life). I later wrote opinion columns before focusing more on my coding.

Today my writing is sadly limited to my personal blog, though I look forward to doing more serious blog articles or reporting in the future if I get the chance.

### I'm a Freethinker

My most prized possessions actually **aren't** my laptop, my laptop backups, or all the stickers I put on my laptop case. It's simply my ability to think and imagine freely. I enjoy reading and thinknig about philosophy since it's a truly unique trait we have as humans and it's important to embrace. Otherwise we risk our humanity and much of our independence.

Do don't be surprised if a good chunk of what I write, or especially tweet, has a philosophical edge sometimes. Asking unexpected questions and questioning unexpected things are ultimately our best weapons as people. Do we truly have free will? Is human nature innately positive or negative? How much can we trust our memories and perceptions? Can we tell when others are unconsciously manipulating our thoughts and decisions? Perhaps most importantly, what's a moral way to live life?

Once I answer what book I'm checking out from the library this weekend, I'll get back to you on the other questions.

#### Random Facts About Me You May Enjoy

1. **I do occassional cartoon drawings** - my big favorite is caricatures of people - ones I know or random ones I see. Who doesn't love a cartoon doppleganger?
2. I'm an amateur guitar player
3. Enjoy boxing in the mornings
4. Obsessed with the Phoenix Wright Franchise
5. If the sky is falling, what was holding it up in the first place? Is it falling because of something we did or something we need to figure out? Is it a warning, an apocalypse, or the start of a horrible Keanu Reeves movie? These are the thoughts that keep me up at night.


I’m Max Antonucci, and for all of my career, I’ve been living in different parts of the digital world.

First it was writing for it as a journalism major. Then doing marketing in it for a few internships. I settled on coding for it as a web developer, but I still love playing in the other areas.

That’s why I’m an all-around digital thinker. I was for most of my time in college, and still am for current job. This includes front-end development of well-performing sites, marketing and analytics to help get them noticed, writing content to convey their message, and social media so they have a real voice for chatting with others.

It’s all for a simple reason: I’m an idea fanatic. At my core I believe that as humans, the best thing we can do is find, share, understand, debate, and create new ideas with each other. They expand our views and experiences, and can make for really amazing tweets. Even if we disagree with different ideas down to our core, we should be curious about them.

The Internet is the best platform today for finding and sharing new ideas. So I channel my passion for ideas into a passion for all things digital, so more people can join the idea marketplace. I’m trying to learn more every day for just that.
